## Goal üèÅ

In this repository you can find a project that consists on using a dataset to analyze a specific topic and complement the information using an API or web scraping.

## Structure of the project files 

- Notebooks: one for cleaning the data and another one for visualization.

- Data: 

    - World Population by Year dataset from [kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/sansuthi/world-population-by-year)

    - [Global atmospheric CO2 Concentration](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/monthly-atm-co2?country=~OWID_WRL)

    - [Ocean temperature data](https://www.currentresults.com/Environment-Facts/changes-in-earth-temperature.php)


- src folder: functions that have been used to clean the data.


# Working plan

The objective of this project is to test through data whether the hypothesis formulated is true: " The increase in ocean temperatures in recent decades is related to population growth."

# Conclusion

As can be seen in the graphs, there is a notable increase in the temperature of the oceans at the same time as population growth. This is due to the increase of CO2, and other greenhouse gases, which have also grown significantly during the last decades, especially since the 1950s as can be seen in the analysis.
